# Testing how the basic input parsing works for the artefact modules. This is a very basic test to ensure that the input is being parsed correctly and that the artefact modules are being called correctly. This will be expanded upon in the future to include more complex tests and to test the actual parsing of the artefacts.
# No unusual edge cases are going to be added on this test.
