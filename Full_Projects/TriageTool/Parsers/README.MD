# Overview
This parsing folder will be used to parse my PowerShell data, I will include tests, logging and example input and output to make this tool simpler to follow and use.


## Testing
Testing was split down into 4 different practice files (Designed to push the parser and test edge cases etc), alongside some randomised data entries I ran on my different windows devices to test multiple laptop and hardware type functionality.
